            <h1>90.1 2022 Section G3.3 Performance Calculations for Other Alterations</h1>

            <h3>90.1 2022 Performance Rating Method</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Section G3.3 Performance Calculations for Other Alterations</strong> was added to 90.1 in 90.1
                2022. It specifies that where an alteration does not meet 90.1 Section G3.1.4a and is therefore required
                to follow Section G3.3, the baseline building systems and equipment in the scope of the retrofit should
                be modeled at efficiency levels meeting the mandatory and prescriptive requirements in Section 5 through
                10 and as described in Section G3.3.2. All other baseline systems and equipment shall be modeled the
                same as in the proposed design. For reference Section G3.1.4 language is provided directly below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>G3.1.4 Alterations.</strong> The simulation model for calculating the proposed building
                performance and baseline building performance for alterations, excluding additions, shall be developed
                in accordance with the applicable subparagraph (a) or (b).

                        In accordance with Section G3.2 for alterations that include replacement of two or more of the
                        following:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                HVAC systems that account for more than 50% of the capacity serving either the heating
                                or cooling loads of the alteration area. This includes HVAC unitary systems, HVAC
                                terminal units, or components of HVAC central heating or cooling equipment. HVAC
                                terminal units, for the purposes of this section, can include VAV boxes, fan-coil units,
                                VRF room units, or water-loop heat pumps;
                            </li>
                            <li>50% or more of the luminaires in the alteration area;</li>
                            <li>
                                25% or more of the building envelope area of the alteration portion of the building,
                                including new exterior cladding, fenestration, or insulation.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>In accordance with Section G3.3 for all other alterations.</li>
                </ol>

            <strong>Example 1</strong>
            <p>
                Question: A project is replacing a chiller that accounts for 75% of the project alteration area cooling
                capacity and is replacing 80% of the luminaires in the alteration area, would the project be required to
                following G3.2 or G3.3? Answer: G3.2 because it meets the criteria associated with both G3.1.4a #1 and
                #2. G3.1.4a #1 applies to the cooling OR heating capacity and because the chiller serves more than 50%
                of the cooling capacity associated with the alteration area cooling loads the project meets #1. The
                project is replacing 50% or more of the luminaires in the alteration area so it meets #2.
            </p>
            <p>Answer: G3.2 because it meets the criteria associated with both G3.1.4a #1 and #2.</p>
            <p>
                G3.1.4a #1 applies to the cooling OR heating capacity and because the chiller serves more than 50% of
                the cooling capacity associated with the alteration area cooling loads the project meets #1.
            </p>
            <p>The project is replacing 50% or more of the luminaires in the alteration area so it meets #2.</p>

            <strong>Example 2</strong>
            <p>
                Question: A project is only replacing a chiller that accounts for 75% of the project alteration area
                cooling capacity, would the project be required to following G3.2 or G3.3?
            </p>
            <p>
                Answer: G3.3 because it only meets the criteria associated with G3.1.4a #1. To be required to follow
                G3.2 the project would need to meet two or more of the scenarios described in G3.1.4a #s 1-3 and it only
                meets one.
            </p>

            <strong>Example 3</strong>
            <p>
                Question: A project is replacing a chiller that accounts for 75% of the project alteration area cooling
                capacity and is replacing 50% of luminaires in 25% of the alteration area covered by the chiller
                replacement, would the project be required to following G3.2 or G3.3?
            </p>
            <p>
                Answer: G3.3 because it only meets the criteria associated with G3.1.4a #1. To be required to follow
                G3.2 the project would need to meet two or more of the scenarios described in G3.1.4a #s 1-3. The reason
                the project does not meet G3.1.4a #2 is because the luminaire replacement only applies to 25% of the
                alteration area so it does not meet the criteria of a 50% or more luminaire replacement in the
                alteration area.

                The instructions for filling out the Compliance Form when following G3.3 are as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                Submit supplementary documentation where modeled values and assumptions cannot be captured using the
                methods described in the bullets below. Some examples include baseline HVAC system capacities and
                modeled baseline efficiency values with fan energy extracted.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>For projects with no new construction building area in the project (i.e., project only
                    includes floor area subject to G3.3).</strong> The project only needs to fill out the tabs and
                    tables associated with proposed design inputs. The baseline tabs/tables do not need to be filled out
                    because the 90.1 Section 5 to 10 prescriptive/mandatory requirements generally auto-populate on the
                    tabs and in tables with proposed design inputs. Because Section G3.3 requires that baseline building
                    systems and equipment in the scope of the retrofit be modeled at efficiency levels meeting the
                    mandatory and prescriptive requirements in Section 5 through 10 it means that the proposed tables
                    will show both proposed and baseline model inputs. However, care should be taken by projects when
                    establishing required model inputs because some Section 5 through 10 prescriptive/mandatory
                    requirements are different for new construction versus alterations and auto populated values in the
                    Compliance Form assume new construction. To address this, projects are instructed to provide an
                    explanation of what inputs values were modeled in the notes sections below relevant Compliance Form
                    tables and to make manual overrides of prescriptive/mandatory requirements, where allowed and as
                    needed, to document compliance with the modeling requirements of Section G3.3.

                    <strong>For projects with a combination of new construction and alterations following G3.3.</strong>
                    Projects are instructed to provide a comment in the relevant notes sections under tables in the
                    Compliance Form indicating which components/systems were modeled in the baseline following Section
                    G3.3 and what inputs values were modeled.

                        Cautionary note for projects involving alterations following 90.1 Section G3.3: When reviewing
                        projects with alterations following 90.1 Section G3.3, which are by definition minor in nature,
                        it’s important to consider that many systems and components will be modeled with existing
                        conditions in the baseline and proposed models due to the requirements of 90.1 G3.3.1b (i.e.,
                        systems and equipment excluded from the scope of retrofit shall be modeled as reflecting the
                        existing conditions in the baseline and proposed models). On the other hand, for systems and
                        components included in the scope of the retrofit, 90.1 Section G3.3.2.1 requires that the
                        baseline be modeled at efficiency levels that align with the mandatory and prescriptive
                        requirements in Sections 5 through 10. Consequently, the default benchmark may not be an
                        appropriate comparison for the baseline results since the 90.1 Section G3.3 rules deviant
                        significantly from the logic used to create the prototype models minimally compliant with 90.1
                        2004.

                    <p>
                        Depending on the relative square footage of the alteration building area following Section G3.3
                        compared to the total square footage, the benchmark source can be modified in Table 4 on the
                        Energy Performance Summary tab to a more appropriate selection. For example, if the entire
                        project is an alteration following Section G3.3 than a more appropriate benchmark for the
                        baseline may be the version of 90.1 that the project is subject to since systems and components
                        included in the scope of the retrofit are modeled at efficiency levels that align with the
                        mandatory and prescriptive requirements in Sections 5 through 10.

                    LI06-B. Table 2 of the Compliance Calculations tab shows non-coincident peak demand for interior
                    lighting. The value is taken from the simulation reports and reflects the maximum modeled interior
                    lighting load (kW). Peak lighting demand depends on the modeled lighting wattage, the hourly
                    lighting schedule, adjustments to the hourly schedule to reflect reduced runtime due to occupancy
                    sensors (if applicable) and modeled daylighting controls. The modeled interior lighting peak demand
                    may be compared to the interior lighting wattage reported on the Interior Lighting Summary tab Table
                    1 “90.1 Prescriptive” column for baseline values. For 90.1 2022 alterations following 90.1 Section
                    G3.3 the coincident peak demand is expected to be lower than the total lighting wattage reported in
                    the Compliance Form due to occupancy sensor and daylighting controls. A multiplier of 0.7 may be
                    used to roughly approximate the impact of such controls on coincident demand, as follows:
                    <p>MLD prop < 0.7 * TLW prop</p>
                    <p>MLD baseline > 0.7 * TLW baseline</p>
                    <p>MLD = modeled noncoincident lighting peak demand from simulation reports[kW]</p>
                    <p>TLW = total lighting wattage from Table 1 of the Interior Lighting Summary tab [kW]</p>
                    <p>
                        As part of this check, it is also helpful to verify that the non-coincident lighting peak demand
                        reported in the Compliance Calculations tab Table 2 matches simulation reports.
