            <h2><strong>Review Methodology</strong></h2>
            <h3><strong>Identifying the Impactful Aspects of the Submittal</strong></h3>
            <p>This section provides tips for identifying systems and components, and the related modeling inputs, that
                have a significant impact on the compliance outcome and that should be targeted in the reviews. The
                impactful building systems and components may be established using a three-step process described below.</p>

            <h5><strong>Step 1: Identify the impactful end uses</strong></h5>
            <p>End uses that fall into the top tier based on either of the following criteria should be considered impactful:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                <li>
                    Contribution toward the difference in energy use between the baseline/budget and proposed design:
                    <br>
                    For example, lighting end use should be considered impactful for both the baseline and proposed design
                    if reduction in lighting energy use of the proposed design relative to the baseline is one of the top three
                    contributors toward the total reported savings. (In this example, the top tier is defined as top three
                    end uses.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contribution toward the total energy use of the proposed design, except when the trade-offs for the
                    end use are not allowed
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The relative contribution toward the total energy use of the budget/baseline design, except when
                        the trade-offs for the end use are not allowed
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Criteria (b) and (c) are important because there are typically multiple differences between the
                        systems and components of the budget/baseline versus proposed design that affect a given end use.
                        Some of the differences may result in energy savings while others in energy penalty. For example,
                        the proposed design may have a less efficient envelope, but a more efficient heating system compared
                        to the budget/baseline, resulting in a similar heating energy use in the budget/baseline and proposed
                        design. In such scenarios, criteria (a) may not be triggered, but criteria (b) and (c) would apply
                        if heating end use is a significant contributor toward energy use of the budget/baseline or proposed
                        design. This will ensure that the trade-offs between envelope and heating are evaluated as part
                        of the review.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Criteria (b) and (c) are not applicable to end uses for which no trade-offs are allowed, such as
                        miscellaneous equipment for projects following 90.1 Section 11 (called Section 12 in 90.1-2022) or
                        documenting the minimum compliance following 90.1 Appendix G, or exterior lighting for projects following
                        Section 11 (called Section 12 in 90.1-2022).
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Tables 2-4 of the Energy Performance Summary tab of the Compliance Form rank the end uses
                based on these criteria using simulation results reported in the Compliance Calculations tab (Figure 5).
                The ranking may be different depending on units used to express simulation results. Since 90.1 Energy
                Cost Budget and Performance Rating Method compliance is based on energy cost, the impactful end uses
                should also be determined on the cost basis. Alternative units may be used when required by AHJ or
                rating authority.

            <h5><strong>Step 2: Identify the impactful systems and components</strong></h5>
            <p>Systems and components associated with the impactful end uses are shown in Table 1 and should be
                considered impactful.</p>
            <h5><strong>Step 3: Identify the performance characteristics and operating conditions that drive the
                modeled energy use of the impactful systems and components</strong></h5>
            <p>The performance characteristics and operating conditions that drive the modeled energy use of the
                impactful systems and components are shown in Table 1.</p>
