            <h3>Overview of Simulation General Checks</h3>

            <p>
                Simulation General checks help gauge the general quality of the submittal, such as whether an approved
                simulation tool and weather file were used, modeled floor area reflects design documents, and
                simulation results reported in the Compliance Form reflect simulation output reports.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, there are checks that compare modeled energy use of the baseline/budget and proposed
                design to the selected benchmarks to verify that the simulation results are reasonable. The relevant
                information is shown on the Energy Performance Summary tab of the Compliance Form in both the
                tabular and graphical format (Figure 9). Significant deviations between the modeled energy use
                intensities of the baseline/budget and proposed design and the benchmark should be flagged, as
                discussed in the specific checks described below.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../assets/images/section1-6/figure-9.png"
                     style="max-width: 550px; min-width: 550px;">
                <figcaption><strong>Figure 9: Energy Performance Summary tab of the Compliance Form, Benchmark Comparison
                </strong></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>

            <p>Of especial concern are the instances when the baseline/budget EUI is significantly higher than the
            benchmark or proposed EUI is significantly lower than the benchmark as it may result in overly
            optimistic compliance outcome. </p>

            <p>However, the differences may be justified by different operating conditions (e.g., longer daily operating
            hours) between the project and the benchmark and the building use (e.g., school project that has a
            swimming pool versus school benchmark with no swimming pool). The configurations of the
            benchmarks are summarized in the scorecards which can be downloaded at the
            <a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/prototype-building-models">DOE Building Energy Codes Program website</a>.
            In addition, a large difference may be acceptable for end uses that account for
            a small percentage of energy use in both benchmark and completed models, such as heating energy use
            in Miami or cooling energy use in Alaska. </p>

            <p>Table 3 summarizes the checks included in the Simulation General section. </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>If AHJ/RA has pre-approved weather files that must be used for specific project locations,
                        confirm that the weather file listed in the Compliance Form and in the model is approved.
                    </li>
                    <li>If AHJ/RA does not have pre-approved weather files, as a general rule projects should use a
                        weather file for the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) station closest to the project site. In
                        areas with large elevation changes or microclimates, the closest station may be at a
                        significantly different elevation and therefore have different weather or psychrometric
                        characteristics or may be in a different microclimate. In such cases, a weather station at
                        similar elevation and latitude or similar microclimate may be a better fit.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the weather station is determined, TMY2, TMY3, or TMYx data files for the selected station
                        should be used (for projects located in the United States). TMYx data reflects more recent
                        weather patterns compared to TMY3 and TMY2 data. Alternative weather data sources, such as those
                        accounting for expected climate change, may be allowed with sufficient supporting documentation.
                    </li>
                    <li>The same weather file must be used for the budget/baseline and proposed design simulations.

                <h5>Review Tips</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check that the project floor area reported in Table 1 of the General Information tab aligns with
                        the design documents. In addition, check that the classification of the project floor areas
                        reported in Table 1 on the General Information tab aligns with the design in terms of the floor
                        area described as “new construction”, “alteration” and “modeled existing to remain – no
                        alteration” and “conditioned”, “semi-heated and unconditioned”, and “space not enclosed” (click
                        the help text for definitions).

                    </li>
                    <li>For 90.1 2022 projects, verify that the selection in the “Does Alteration Area Meet
                        G3.1.4a/11.1.4.1?” column aligns with design documents (click the help text for an explanation
                        of these sections). This selection is important in that it impacts the compliance calculation
                        for PRM projects and, if the answer is “No”, PRM projects must follow 90.1 Section G3.3 instead
                        of Section G3.2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Small deviations between the modeled area and the area specified in the design documents are
                        common and may be acceptable. Below are some common reasons for the mismatch.<br>

                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Gross floor area reported in the design documents is based on the definition in the 2015
                            IBC, which differs from the 90.1 – 2016 definition (both are quoted below). ECB and PRM do
                            not specify how building area should be inputted into the model, e.g. whether it should be
                            based on the inside perimeter of the exterior walls (based on the IBC definition), or the
                            outside perimeter of the exterior walls (90.1 definition), so it may be modeled either way.

                            conditioned, semi-heated, or unconditioned spaces and un-enclosed spaces, such as
                            crawlspaces, attics, and parking garages with natural or mechanical ventilation (see 90.1
                            definition of unconditioned space). Un-enclosed spaces may be modeled with ambient
                            conditions, thus not contributing to the modeled floor area.
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Multilevel spaces such as stairwells may be modeled as an open shaft (i.e., modeled area =
                            area of the footprint), or as multiple floors (modeled area = area of the footprint times
                            the number of floors the space spans).
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">To ensure a fair comparison between the floor areas shown in the simulation reports and the
                            design documents, it’s important to understand how the floor area is reported by the
                            simulation tool. For example, certain simulation reports may show conditioned floor area,
                            others the gross floor area including unconditioned spaces and plenums, etc.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>+/- 5% difference between the modeled floor area of heated and cooled spaces and the area of the
                        corresponding spaces listed in the design documents may be acceptable. Higher deviations may be
                        permitted with an appropriate explanation.</p>

                    1. Use simulation reports listed below to confirm that the modeled project floor area is as reported
                    in the Compliance Form and the same in the baseline/budget and proposed design. Project floor area
                    is reported in Table 1 of the General Information tab

                    with one or more zones with an unmet cooling load or unmet heating load is defined as an unmet load

                <ol>
                    <li>Unmet load hours (UMLH) are reported in Table 1 on the Compliance Calculations tab of the
                        Compliance Form.

                    <li>
                        The prescribed limits should be enforced for most projects because high UMLHs are often due to
                        simulation errors that may have a high impact on the compliance outcome. The higher the UMLHs in
                        the proposed design compared to the baseline (budget) model effectively means that even though
                        the two models have the same thermostat setpoints, the actual space temperatures in the proposed
                        design were lower during the heating season and/or higher during the cooling season. This will
                        reduce energy use of the proposed design, which is not an allowed trade-off. Below are several
                        common reasons for a high UMLH.

                                The thermostat schedules do not align with the schedules associated with HVAC system
                                operation, occupant schedules, miscellaneous equipment schedules, outside air ventilation
                                schedules and other schedules of operation that could affect the HVAC system’s ability to meet
                                loads in the thermal block.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The inputs for internal gains, occupants and outside air ventilation are unreasonable and
                                inconsistent with the intended operation of the building.

                                The simulated operation of the controls associated with primary or secondary heating or cooling
                                equipment (pumps, coils, boilers, etc.) is out of alignment with the heating and cooling
                                requirements of the building.
                            </li>

                                Inadequate equipment capacity in the proposed design.
                                Example: The specified equipment may be intentionally under-sized to achieve higher part load
                                performance, resulting in unmet loads during extreme conditions. In this case, the modeled
                                thermostat setpoints should be adjusted to ensure that the UMLH in the proposed design are
                                within the required limits. Once such the thermostat schedule is established, it must be
                                modeled the same in the baseline/budget and proposed designs.

                                Reviewer may judge a submittal with 350 UMLHs (that exceed the 300 limit by 50 hours) to be
                                acceptable, but reject a submittal with 800 UMLHs (that exceed the 300 limit by 500 hours).

                                For example, the AHJ may accept a submittal if the actual zone temperatures during an UMLH is
                                one or two degrees outside of the throttling range, but reject submittals with larger
                                discrepancies, for example if during the UMLH the temperature in the thermal block is 60F
                                compared to a 70F heating setpoint.

                <p>PRM and ECB compliance is established based on the simulation outputs for the baseline (budget) and
                    proposed design. The Compliance Form allows modelers to copy results from the standard simulation
                    output reports generated by the supported modeling tools into the designated areas to auto-populate
                    the template with the simulation results, to avoid mistakes from manual data transfer. Performing
                    this check should involve the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Confirm that electricity (kWh) and natural gas (Therm) use for the baseline/budget design
                        reported in the Compliance Calculations tab of the compliance form matches the submitted
                        simulation reports.
                    </li>
                    <li>Confirm that the total baseline/budget design energy cost reported in the Compliance
                        Calculations tab matches the submitted simulation reports.
                    </li>
                    <li>Confirm that electricity (kWh) and natural gas (Therm) use for the proposed design reported in
                        the Compliance Calculations tab matches the submitted simulation reports.
                    </li>
                    <li>Confirm that the total proposed energy cost reported in the Compliance Calculations tab matches
                        the submitted simulation reports.
                    </li>
                    <li>Spot-check electricity and gas use for individual end uses reported in the compliance form
                        versus simulation reports.
