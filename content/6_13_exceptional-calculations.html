                            Compliance Form. Prioritize review of exceptional calculations that are expected to generate
                            the greatest savings based on the information provided in Table 2 of the tab.

                            specifically allowed to be different (see Table 11.5.1 No 1 (12.5.1 No 1 in 90.1 2022) and

                            In addition, the submittal includes $9,000 savings from a ventilated faÃ§ade which could not be
                            modeled in the simulation tool. The savings were determined using exceptional calculations and
                            documented as required in 90.1 Section G2.5. What proposed building performance should be used
                            to calculate PRM compliance following 90.1 Section G1.2.2?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A: The difference between the baseline and proposed energy cost without accounting for exceptional
                            calculations is $100,000-$92,000=$8,000. The savings from exceptional calculations are greater than
                            $8,000*0.5=$4,000, thus the allowed contribution of the exceptional calculations toward savings is
                            capped at $4,000. The proposed energy cost that must be used in the compliance calculations is
                            $92,000-$4,000=$88,000. The Performance Cost Index is equal to $88,000 / $100,000=0.88.

                            exceptional calculations is $100,000-$92,000=$8,000. This means that savings from exceptional
                            calculations are capped at $8,000 (i.e., at $8,000 the total exceptional savings would constitute
