            <h2>Organization of the Review Manual</h2>
            <p>The <a href="../content/3_submittal-review-quick-start.html">Submittal Review Quick Start</a> (Section 3) describes
                how this Manual may be used by different user groups including the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Building code officials and other professionals tasked with reviews of modeling-based submittals.
                </li>
                <li>Energy modelers who may use procedures outlined in the Manual for internal quality control before
                    submitting to AHJ/RA.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <a href="../content/4_review-process.html">Review Process</a> (Section 4) of this Manual provides a step-by-step
                overview of the submittal review process including references to the tabs of the Compliance Form and sections
                of the Manual relevant to each step.</p>

            <p>The <a href="../content/3_submittal-review-quick-start.html">Submittal Review Methodology</a>
                (Section 5) of this Manual summarizes the general concept of Standard 90.1 Energy Cost Budget and Performance
                Rating Method compliance, describes the types of review checks included in the Manual, and includes recommendations
                for identifying impactful aspects of the submittal to help prioritize review effort. The section also discusses
                how to use the QC Checks tab of the Compliance Form to establish the scope of the review.</p>

            <p>The <a href="../content/6_1_nomenclature.html">Review Checks</a> (Section 6) of this Manual is a comprehensive
                library of checks that may be performed. The checks are organized in subsections based on the type of building
                systems and components, such as interior lighting, building envelope, etc. The description of each check
                includes references to the relevant sections of 90.1, review tips including where the relevant information
                may be found in the Compliance Form, common mistakes, and references to the applicable simulation reports
                for the supported tools.</p>

            <p>Annotated simulation reports are included for each check in which they are referenced to help locate the
                necessary information.</p>

            <p>The following additional Standard 90.1 resources are available and may include requirements applicable to
                special situations and exceptions that are beyond the scope of this Manual:</p>

                <strong>Standard 90.1 Section G3.2 (New Construction/Major Alterations) and G3.3 (Minor
                Alterations)</strong>
                <br>
                New buildings, additions, and alterations (i.e., New Construction/Major Alterations) meeting 90.1 2022
                G3.1.4a follow the modeling requirements in Standard 90.1-2022 Section G3.2. All other alterations
                (i.e., Minor Alterations) follow the modeling requirements in Standard 90.1-2022 Section G3.3. In each
                section of this document where 90.1 requirements differ across 90.1 Sections G3.2 and G3.3, separate
                headings are presented for G3.2 and G3.3 with a description of the requirements associated with each
                under the applicable heading. Refer to section
                <a href="../content/6_14_90-1-2022-section-g3-3.html">
                    90.1 2022 Section G3.3 Performance Calculations for Other Alterations
                </a>
                in the
                <a href="../content/6_1_nomenclature.html">Review Checks (Section 6)</a>
                for a more detailed explanation and review tips specific to alterations subject to 90.1 Section G3.3.

                <strong>G3.2 New Construction/Major Alterations</strong>
                <br>
                Requirements for 90.1 G3.2 specifically will be included under this heading.
                <br>
                <strong>G3.3 Minor Alterations</strong>
