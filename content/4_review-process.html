            <h2>Review Process</h2>
            <p>
                This section describes the submittal review process utilizing the QC Checks tab of the Compliance Form.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 1: Check Submittal for Completeness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use the Submittal + Mand. Req. Checklists tab of the Compliance Form to verify that all required
                    materials are provided. Request additional information if submittal is incomplete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Review the Dashboard tab of the Compliance Form to verify compliance outcome and confirm that the
                    modeler and design professional signed off on the submittal as required.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Get General Understanding of the Project</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Review the General Information tab of the Compliance Form to understand building type, size,
                    location, whether it’s a new construction or renovation, and the compliance path followed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Review the Energy Performance Summary tab of the Compliance Form to understand which end uses have a
                    significant impact on the modeled energy use. (See
                    <a href="../content/5_3_identifying-impactful-aspects.html">
                    Identifying Impactful Aspects of the Submittal section
                    </a>.)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Establish Review Scope</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Open the Quality Control Checks tab of the Compliance Form (Figure 3). The tab includes all review
                    checks listed in the manual. For some checks, the “Include in Review” box will be set to “Yes” by
                    default based on the logic described in the Establishing Review Scope section of this Manual. It is
                    recommended that the review at minimum includes these checks.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <img src="../assets/images/section1-6/figure-3.png"
                     alt="Figure 3: Quality Control Checks tab of the Compliance Form"
                     style="max-width: 900px;">

            </figure>

            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    For some of the pre-selected checks, the review outcome is automatically set to “Pass” or “Fail”
                    based on the information provided on other tabs of the Compliance Form. For checks with a “Fail”
                    outcome, a default review comment is displayed and may be edited by the reviewer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Follow recommendations in the
                    <em><a href="../content/5_3_identifying-impactful-aspects.html">
                    Identifying Impactful Aspects of the Submittal section</a></em>
                    and
                    <em><a href="../content/5_4_establishing-review-scope.html">
                    Establishing Review Scope
                    </a></em>
                    sections of the Manual to identify additional checks to be performed on the project. For these
                    checks, set the “Include in Review” box to “Yes” in the Quality Control Checks tab of the Compliance
                    Form (Figure 3).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Perform the Review</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Perform the selected review checks in the order listed in the QC Checks tab of the Compliance Form.
                    Record “Pass” or “Fail” outcome for each check and provide actionable review comments for each check
                    with the “Fail” outcome.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A “Pass” outcome means that no changes are required in the given area and any provided
                            comments can be treated as informative.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A “Fail” outcome means that changes must be made to the submittal before it is approved. In
                            this case, the issues and required changes should be described in the review comment.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Confirm the outcome on the checks that are automatically set to “Pass” and update the outcome if
                    necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the CheckID provided in the QC Checks tab to locate the 90.1 references and tips for performing
                    the check in the Review Checks section of the Manual as necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For checks that involve verifying simulation reports, use the names of the reports listed for each
                    check to locate the annotated reports in the Simulation Reports section of the Manual.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Communicate Review Outcome to the Permit Applicant</h3>
            <p>
                Provide written comments to the applicant if corrective actions are required or approve the submittal.
                The comments may be communicated by returning the Compliance Form with the filled-out Quality Control
                Checks tab to the applicant.
