            <ol>
                <li>
                    If there are multiple water heater types, the review should focus on water heaters with the largest
                    capacity or a representative smaller unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hot water demand checks should only be performed for Appendix G projects where different hot
                    water demand is reported in the Compliance Form for the baseline versus proposed design.

            </ol>

            <p>For 90.1 2022 PRM alterations subject to G3.3 (i.e., Minor Alterations), the summary tables on the
               Quality Control Checks tab in the Compliance Form may not reflect correct values for the baseline since
               projects, for the most part, only enter proposed design information and provide notes as to what was
               modeled in the baseline in the notes fields associated with the proposed design related tables. Refer to

                        product of the number of heaters and nameplate input rate per heater, and focus the review on
                        these units only.

                        The reference to drawings/specs where information for each heater is available should be included

                        Hot water demand is reported in Table 4 of the Service Water Heating tab for the residential
                        occupancies and in Table 5 for all others.

                        ECB: the amount of service hot water consumed in the building is not a trade-off opportunity and
                        must be modeled the same in the budget building and the proposed design.

                                Projects may document a reduction in demand provided the methodology is approved by
                                the building official. For example, on projects with low-flow fixtures, hot water demand in
                                the Proposed Design may be reduced to reflect the lower flow rates of the installed fixtures
                                compared to the maximum flow allowed by the applicable code or standard.

                <h3>SWH06 Difference in the baseline/budget and proposed hot water use is reasonable based on the system
                    parameters reported in the Compliance Form</h3>

                <h5>Review Tips</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        ECB: Since the budget SWH system must be of the same type and use the same fuel as the proposed
                        system and the reduction in the hot water demand is not a trade-off opportunity, the difference
                        in SWH energy use between the budget and proposed design depends only on the difference in
                        efficiencies of the budget and proposed systems.
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            SWH_Use<sub>prop</sub> * SWH_Eff<sub>prop</sub> = SWH_Use<sub>budget</sub> * SWH_Eff<sub>budget</sub>
                        </p>
                        <p>SWH_Use [MMBtu] = the annual SWH use from simulation output reports</p>
                        <p>SWH_Eff = SWH efficiency reported in the submittal</p>
                        <p>
                            Projects that do not show this pattern should be flagged and explanation and supporting documentation
                            should be requested. Higher savings may be demonstrated by projects that have solar hot water
                            preheat as allowed by 90.1 Section 11.4.3.1/12.4.3.1, or other means of service hot water preheat, such
                            as use of condenser heat recovery, that differs between the budget and proposed design.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        90.1 PRM: The baseline SWH system may be of a different type and use a different fuel than the
                        proposed SWH system and there may be a difference in hot water demand between the baseline
                        and proposed design, thus this check cannot be effectively performed. For alterations following 90.1
                        2022 Section G3.3 (i.e., Minor Alterations) that are not modeling a reduction in hot water demand
                        the check described in review tip #1 can be performed using the baseline and proposed efficiency
                        values reported in Table 1 on the Service Water Heating tab in the Compliance Form.

                    <li>
                        SWH effective full load hours are equal to the ratio of the annual service water heating energy use
                        from the simulation outputs to the reported service water heater capacity. Effective full load hours
                        which are higher than typical included in Appendix A may indicate that modeled service water
                        heating demand exceeds the values anticipated by the design team and that the modeled service
                        water heater energy use is exaggerated. EFLH exceeding typical by more than 25%, or exceeding
                        8760 hours per year, should be flagged.
