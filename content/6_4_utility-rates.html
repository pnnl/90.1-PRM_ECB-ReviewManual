            <h3>Overview of the Utility Rate Checks</h3>

            <p>
                Utility Rate checks verify that utility rates from the approved source were used for all applicable fuels,
                that the required supporting information is included in the submittal, and that modeling inputs and
                outputs reflect the reported rate structure. Table 4 summarizes the checks included in the Utility Rates
                section. This group of checks may be skipped if project documents compliance using unit other than
                energy cost, such as site or source energy or emissions, which may be allowed by some rating
                authorities and jurisdictions.

                    <li>
                        All fuels applicable to the baseline/budget or proposed design must be listed on the Energy Sources tab
                        of the Compliance Form. Table 1 includes the list of fuels and description of utility rates for each.

                        </figure>
                        The fee structures for each fuel is further described in Tables 2-4 of the Energy Sources tab.
                        Table 2 is used for reporting rates that have uniform charges, Table 3 for time of use charges,
                        Table 4 for block charges. These tables also list Source of Data for each rate which may include
                        Actual Rates, EIA Rates or Other.

                        </figure>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        With the EIA option, the most recent annual average rates for electricity and natural gas published
                        at the EIA website should be used. These rates are readily available and are simple usage charges such
                        as $/kWh.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The actual rates may be more challenging to establish for a new construction project, as several different
                        rate classes and choice of electricity suppliers may apply. The actual rates may also be harder to
                        model as they often include block charges, time of use charges, demand charges, ratchet clauses, etc.
                        However, using the actual rates makes models more representative of the post-occupancy energy costs
                        and allows capturing impact of electricity demand and time of use on compliance.
                        If actual utility rates are used on the project, the supporting information should be included in the
                        submittal (Submittal Checklist #7), such as rate description from the utility company.

                <h3>UR02 The difference between the average (virtual) modeled budget/baseline and proposed utility rates
                    for electricity, natural gas and other applicable energy sources are as expected. </h3>

                        Background <br>
                        The average annual rate, often referred to as the virtual rate, is calculated for each fuel as the
                        ratio of the annual fuel consumption to the annual fuel cost. For example, if the simulation output
                        reports show that the baseline annual electricity use was 509,150 kWh and the annual electricity cost
                        was $76,370, the virtual electricity rate is $76,370 / 509,150kWh = 0.15 $/kWh.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For projects that used EIA rates or the actual rates with fixed usage charges (e.g. $/kWh, $/Therm) and
                        no demand, time of use, or block charges, the virtual rate is expected to be the same for the
                        budget/baseline and the proposed design and match the rate reported on the Energy Sources tab of the
                        Compliance Form. For projects that use more complex utility rate structures, virtual rates may differ
                        between the budget/baseline and proposed design. For example, the virtual electricity rate for the proposed
                        design may be lower than for the budget (baseline) design if the proposed design reduces the peak demand and
                        the modeled electricity rates include demand charges.

                            Virtual utility rates for the budget/baseline and proposed design that are not equal for projects with simple
                            utility rate structures or differ by more than 5% for projects with complex utility rate structures, should be
