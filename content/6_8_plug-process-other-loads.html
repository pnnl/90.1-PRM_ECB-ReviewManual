            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p>
                This category includes receptacle loads, non-HVAC motors, process loads, refrigeration equipment,
                elevators and other systems and components reported on Plug, Process and Other Loads tab of the
                Compliance Form. Some of these systems, such as certain refrigeration equipment and elevators, are
                regulated by 90.1, while others are not. Table 9 summarizes the checks included in this group.

                Table 10 illustrates whether trade-offs are allowed for systems and components included in the PPO
                category by the Energy Cost Budget and Performance Rating Methods. If trade-offs are not allowed, the
                review should be limited to verifying that the energy use of the associated systems and equipment is the
                same in the baseline/budget and proposed designs. No other checks are necessary.

                In addition, skip review checks for the following systems and components if they are not reported in the

            <p>
                Within the given type of equipment, focus on verifying units with the highest contribution to the total
                energy use of that category or that are representative and spot-check the rest. For example, if a
                project includes 10 passenger elevators of the same type and two service elevators, the review should
                focus on the passenger elevator.

                For 90.1 2022 PRM alterations subject to G3.3 (i.e., Minor Alterations), the summary tables on the
                Quality Control Checks tab in the Compliance Form may not reflect correct values for the baseline since
                projects, for the most part, only enter proposed design information and provide notes as to what was
                modeled in the baseline in the notes fields associated with the proposed design related tables. Refer to
                the

                        11.4.3.2, where CHP waste heat is recovered in the proposed design, the budget building design
                        must be based on the energy source used as the backup energy source, or electricity if no backup
                        energy source has been specified. In the proposed design, the recovered waste heat must not be
