            <strong>Rank 0</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Review check is automated via the Compliance Form and is always included.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Always assigned Rank 0.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Rank 1</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Required for all Tiers 2–5.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Includes high-priority items like EUI thresholds and general PRM/ECB requirements (e.g., unmet load hours).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Always assigned Rank 1.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Rank 2</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Always assigned Rank 2.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Rank 3</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Always assigned Rank 3.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Rank 4</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Always assigned Rank 4.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Rank 1 or 4</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the check affects an impactful end use, assign Rank 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Otherwise, assign Rank 4.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Rank 2, 3, or 4</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Rank determined based on both the relevance of the check to impactful end uses and the project’s context:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>Rank 2:</em> Check targets an impactful end use and is especially significant due to building type,
                            climate zone, or number of floors (e.g., a 24/7 facility in a cold climate).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Rank 3:</em> Check targets an impactful end use, but without a context that makes it particularly
                            critical.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>Rank 4:</em> Check does not target an impactful end use.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Rank 3 or 4</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Rank 3:</em> Check targets an impactful end use, but its relative impact is always lower.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Rank 4:</em> Check does not target an impactful end use.
                </li>
            </ul>
