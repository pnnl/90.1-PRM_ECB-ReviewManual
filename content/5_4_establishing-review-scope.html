            <h2><strong>Review Methodology</strong></h2>
            <h3><strong>Establishing Review Scope</strong></h3>
            <p>
                The goal of the review is to identify whether any specified systems or components must be changed in
                order for the design to comply with the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Energy Cost Budget Method or Performance
                Rating Method. Both compliance options require designs to meet the applicable mandatory provisions of
                the Standard; thus, any identified issues with the mandatory requirements will necessitate changes to
                the design.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the 90.1 Energy Cost Budget and Performance Rating Methods allow performance trade-offs between
                systems and components (with the exception of not meeting mandatory provisions), identifying
                issues pertaining to the impactful systems are likely to affect the compliance outcome and necessitate
                changes to the design. On the other hand, uncovering issues with systems that have relatively low impact
                on the modeled energy cost of baseline/budget and proposed design may result in updates to the models
                and/or information reported in the Compliance Form without any changes to the design documents.
                Incidentally, it is important to stress that some of the systems and components that fall into the low
                impact category for the purpose of 90.1 compliance modeling may have high impact on building lifecycle
                cost and occupant comfort.

                <li>
                    <strong>Review Time Classification</strong> — Each check is assigned a number from 1 to 5 to represent the estimated
                    level of effort required. These values are preset in the Compliance Form and are for reference only. The time
                    estimates below provide a general guideline, though actual duration may vary based on factors such as project size,
                    complexity, reviewer experience, and the quality and completeness of submitted materials. Effort estimates:

                    <strong>Identifying Review Checks Connected to Impactful End-Uses</strong> – Each check is dynamically assigned
                    a "Yes" or "No" based on whether it involves systems and components that influence an end-use identified as
                    impactful. If the review check is associated with any of the end-uses identified as impactful following the
                    method described in the Identifying Impactful Aspects of the Submittal section then it will be marked as “Yes”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ranking</strong> — For each check, a ranking is determined. The following are the assigned rankings and
                    their meaning.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            0: Automated checks - always conducted for all tiers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1: Always conducted for Tiers 2-5. These include EUI checks and general requirements of the PRM or ECB,
                            such as verifying that unmet load hours do not exceed allowable limits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2: Checks that have a significant impact on energy consumption AND where the systems and components associated
                            with the check affect end-use(s) determined to be impactful for the project (i.e., the check was assigned
                            a “Yes’ according to the bullet above). Project attributes like number of stories, building type, and
                            climate zone (CZ) will be considered when dynamically assigning a ranking of either a 2 or 3 to a check.
                            For example, slab on grade construction related to checks for a single-story school in climate zone
                            6A will receive a ranking of 2, whereas those checks for a 15-story office in CZ 2A will receive a
                            ranking of 3.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            3: Checks that have a less significant impact on energy consumption AND where the systems and components
                            associated with the check affect end-use(s) determined to be impactful for the project. Project attributes
                            like number of stories, building type, and climate zone will be considered when dynamically assigning
                            a ranking of either a 2 or 3 to a check.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            4: These are the checks that either always have a less significant impact on energy consumption OR are
                            checks that were found to not affect any of the impactful end uses determined for the project.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Review Check Selection Logic</h4>
            <p>
                The following logic and process is used for determining whether “Include in Review” will be set equal to “Yes” or “No”
                dynamically for each review check on the Quality Control Checks tab in the Compliance Form. Steps 2-4 are automated
                in the Compliance Form.
            </p>
            <ul style = 1em>
                <li>
                    <strong>Step 1: Selection of review tier.</strong> For each project review, the reviewer must determine the
                    appropriate review tier, considering both the available review time and the desired level of rigor. The review tier
                    is selected on the Quality Control Checks tab in the Compliance Form.
                    <br><br>
                    When aligning the selected tier with the allocated review time, several factors should be taken into account:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Reviewer Experience – Less experienced reviewers may require additional time to complete reviews.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Project Complexity – More complex projects generally demand longer review times, even at lower tiers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Quality of Submitted Materials – Projects submitted with well-prepared, high-quality documentation often
                            require significantly less review time compared to those with incomplete or inconsistent materials.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                            By carefully assessing these elements, reviewers can select a tier that balances efficiency and thoroughness while
                            ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the project.
                        <br><br>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step 2: Identify impactful end-uses and checks that pertain to these end-uses.</strong> Impactful end
                    uses will be determined automatically in the Compliance Form based on model results using the logic in Identifying
                    Impactful Aspects of the Submittal section. Each check will be marked as Yes/No as to whether it affects any
                    impactful end uses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Step 3: Rank checks.</strong> Rankings of 0 and 1 are not dynamic and are therefore not project specific.
                    These are pre-assigned and remain stable across projects. The checks that received a “Yes” in step 2 will be
                    ranked as either 2 or 3 based on it’s level of influence on energy consumption. A ranking of 2, 3, or 4 will
                    be automatically determined in the Compliance Form based upon attributes of the project including but not
                    limited to impactful end uses, climate zone, building type, number of stories, etc.  See the
                    <a href=#review-check-classifications>Review Check Classifications</a> section for more information
                    regarding ranking. See <a href="../content/appendixB_logic-for-automatic-prioritization">Appendix B: Logic for
                    Automatic Prioritization of Review Checks</a> for the logic applied to each check to determine the ranking on a
                    project-by-project basis.

                    the default logic shown below depending on the tier selected. “Include in Review” will be set equal to “Yes”
                    or “No” dynamically following the logic below. In certain cases, the reviewer may choose to override the default
                    percentages shown below. For example, if a submitter consistently provides high-quality work, the reviewer may
                    adjust the percentage of rank 4 checks conducted from 20% to 5% for a Tier 3 review. Conversely, if a submitter
                    frequently submits lower-quality work, the reviewer may opt to increase the percentage to 40% for a more thorough
                    assessment. The percentage of checks conducted can be manually adjusted on the Quality Control Checks tab in the
                    Compliance Form in the Review Tier section.

                The Review Checks section of the Manual includes subsections dedicated to the key building systems (e.g., interior
                lighting, building envelope, etc.). Each subsection starts with an introduction that includes a table listing the
                available checks based on their type, as defined in the first column of Table 2, and component being addressed (e.g.,
                lighting wattage, lighting controls, etc.) These introductory sections also include the sampling recommendations. For
                example, verification that the specified lighting fixture wattage reported in the compliance form reflects design
                document should focus on fixtures that account for the largest share of the specified wattage and spot-checking other
                fixtures.
