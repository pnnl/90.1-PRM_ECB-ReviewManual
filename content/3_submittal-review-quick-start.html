            <h2>Submittal Review Quick Start</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>For AHJ and RA Administrators</h3>
            <p>See the <a href ="https://www.energycodes.gov/">DOE Energy Codes website</a> for recommendations for organizing an
                effective and efficient submittal review process including but not limited to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adoption of the
                    <a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/performance_based_compliance">
                        90.1 Performance-based Compliance Form
                    </a>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    Establishing the minimum qualification requirements for energy modelers and submittal reviewers,
                </li>
                <li>And third-party reviewer scope of work template.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Before performing the first review:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            Review the submittal review policy documents published by AHJ/RA to understand the
                            documentation requirements, review scope, target turnaround time, and budget.
                        </li>

                            the methodology for identifying impactful aspects of the submittal, and the tools available
                            in the Compliance Form to help facilitate the reviews.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Follow the steps outlined in the
                    <a href="../content/4_review-process.html">Review Process</a>
                    section of this Manual to perform a review.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>For Energy Modelers</h3>
            <p>
                Modelers and design teams should use the same process as described above for the Submittal Reviewers to
                perform quality control before submitting the package for review. This helps minimize review iterations
                and ensures a speedy approval. The following is recommended:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    At minimum, review the QC Checks tab of the Compliance Form to verify that no automated checks
                    result in a “Fail” outcome. Investigate all failed checks and correct the inputs in the appropriate
                    tabs of the Compliance Form and/or in the simulation to resolve the check. If the check is not
                    resolved, provide an explanation for the reviewer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To improve submittal quality, consider completing all checks for which “Include in Review” is
                    automatically set to “Yes” on the QC Checks tab of the Compliance Form. Some jurisdictions and
                    rating authorities may require this step.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When replying to review comments, refer to the Review Checks section of this Manual to understand
                    the 90.1 requirements and common mistakes relevant to the checks.
                </li>
            </ol>
