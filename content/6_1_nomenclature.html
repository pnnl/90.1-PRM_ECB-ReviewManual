            <h1>Nomenclature</h1>
            <p>The review checks included in this section are organized into the following groups:</p>

            <p><a href="../content/6_3_simulation-general.html">Simulation General (SG)</a></p>
            <p>
                SG checks verify compliance with the general simulation requirements such as that an approved simulation
                program was used to model baseline/budget and proposed design, that project’s climate zone was
                established correctly, that simulation results used to establish compliance outcome reflect submitted
                simulation reports, and that the number of unmet load hours does not exceed the specified limit. In
                addition, SG checks verify that the total simulated energy use intensity and energy intensities of
                individual end uses including lighting, miscellaneous loads, heating, cooling, fans, pumps, heat
                rejection, and service water heating are consistent with the selected benchmarks.
            </p>

            <p><a href="../content/6_4_utility-rates.html">Utility Rates (UR)</a></p>
            <p>
                UR checks verify that energy cost is established using utility rates from an approved source and are
                properly modeled.
            </p>

            <p><a href="../content/6_5_building-envelope.html">Building Envelope (BE)</a></p>
            <p>BE checks verify that the envelope geometry, thermal, and solar properties are established and modeled
                correctly.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="../content/6_6_lighting-interior.html">
                    Lighting, Interior (LI)
                </a>
                and
                <a href="../content/6_7_lighting-exterior.html">

                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                LI and LE checks verify that the interior and exterior lighting power and controls are properly
                established and modeled.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="../content/6_8_plug-process-other-loads.html">
                    Plug, Process and Other Loads (PPO)
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                PPO checks verify that the miscellaneous unregulated loads, industrial processes, elevators, regulated
                refrigeration, motors, and combined heat and power systems are properly established and modeled.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="../content/6_9_service-water-heating.html">
                    Service Water Heating (SWH)
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                SWH checks verify that service water heating equipment type, efficiency, and controls, that the related
                auxiliary equipment and hot water demand were established and modeled correctly.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="../content/6_10_airside-hvac.html">
                    Air-side HVAC Systems (AHVAC)
                </a>
                and
                <a href="../content/6_11_waterside-hvac.html">
                    Water-side HVAC Systems (WHVAC)
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                AHVAC and WHVAC checks verify heating, cooling, and ventilation system type, capacity, efficiency, and
                controls, and parameters of the related auxiliary components such as fans, pumps, and heat rejection
                equipment were established correctly and properly modeled.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="../content/6_12_renewable-energy.html">
                    Renewable Energy (RE)
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                RE checks cover renewable electricity and thermal energy generation systems such as photovoltaic (PV)
                systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="../content/6_13_exceptional-calculations.html">
                    Exceptional Calculations (EC)
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                EC checks address calculations that were completed outside of the simulation tool. The checks are only
                relevant to projects involving renewable systems or exceptional calculations, respectively.
            </p>

            <p>In addition, checks are designated as applying to the Baseline/Budget Design or Proposed Design.</p>

            <strong>Budget/Baseline Design (B)</strong>
            <p>
                B checks confirm that the baseline (budget) design described in the submittal reflects the requirements
                of the selected compliance path and is modeled as reported.
            </p>

            <strong>Proposed Design (P)</strong>
            <p>
                P checks verify that the parameters of the proposed design reported in the Compliance Form match design
                documents, comply with applicable 90.1 mandatory requirements, and are appropriately modeled.
            </p>

            <p><em>Example of the format for distinguishing between 90.1 G3.2 and G3.3 requirements through the Review Checks Section</em>
                <br><strong><u>G3.2 New Construction/Major Alterations</u></strong><br>
                Requirements for 90.1 G3.2 specifically will be included under this heading.<br>
                <br><strong><u>G3.3 Minor Alterations</u></strong><br>
                Requirements for 90.1 G3.3 specifically will be included under this heading.</p>

            <p>
                Each check has CheckID expressed using this nomenclature. For example, BE08-P is check #8 related to
                building envelope (BE) for the proposed design (P).
            </p>

            <p>Check Group Information</p>
            <p>Sections below list the checks included in each check group. The following information is provided for each check:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Summary of the relevant 90.1 requirements</li>
                <li>
                    Review tips including location of the relevant information in the Compliance Form, steps for
                    completing the check, sampling recommendations for checks that apply to multiple similar systems and
                    components (e.g. HVAC systems), and common mistakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For review checks that involve verifying simulation inputs or outputs, list of the relevant
                    simulation reports of commonly used BEM. The annotated reports are included in the Simulation
                    Reports section of this Manual.
                </li>
