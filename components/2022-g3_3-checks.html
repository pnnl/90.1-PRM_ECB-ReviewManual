              <p>The benchmarks for the proposed designs are selected in Table 4 of the Energy Performance Summary tab of the Compliance Form. The default benchmarks for projects following the PRM baseline are set based on DOE/PNNL prototype models (the prototype models) using the appropriate building type and climate zone, compliant with 90.1 2004.

              <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Cautionary note for projects involving alterations following 90.1 Section G3.3: When reviewing projects with alterations following 90.1 Section G3.3, which are by definition minor in nature, it’s important to consider that many systems and components will be modeled with existing conditions in the baseline and proposed models due to the requirements of 90.1 G3.3.1b (i.e., systems and equipment excluded from the scope of retrofit shall be modeled as reflecting the existing conditions in the baseline and proposed models). On the other hand, for systems and components included in the scope of the retrofit, 90.1 Section G3.3.2.1 requires that the baseline be modeled at efficiency levels that align with the mandatory and prescriptive requirements in Sections 5 through 10. Consequently, the default benchmark may not be an appropriate comparison for the baseline results since the 90.1 Section G3.3 rules deviate significantly from the logic used to create the prototype models minimally compliant with 90.1 2004.</p>
                <p>Depending on the relative square footage of the alteration building area following Section G3.3 compared to the total square footage, the benchmark source can be modified in Table 4 on the Energy Performance Summary tab to a more appropriate selection. For example, if the entire project is an alteration following Section G3.3, then a more appropriate benchmark for the baseline may be the version of 90.1 that the project is subject to since systems and components included in the scope of the retrofit are modeled at efficiency levels that align with the mandatory and prescriptive requirements in Sections 5 through 10.</p>

              <p>LI06-B. Table 2 of the Compliance Calculations tab shows non-coincident peak demand for interior lighting. The value is taken from the simulation reports and reflects the maximum modeled interior lighting load (kW). Peak lighting demand depends on the modeled lighting wattage, the hourly lighting schedule, adjustments to the hourly schedule to reflect reduced runtime due to occupancy sensors (if applicable) and modeled daylighting controls. The modeled interior lighting peak demand may be compared to the interior lighting wattage reported on the Interior Lighting Summary tab Table 1 “90.1 Prescriptive” column for baseline values. For 90.1 2022 alterations following 90.1 Section G3.3 the coincident peak demand is expected to be lower than the total lighting wattage reported in the Compliance Form due to occupancy sensor and daylighting controls. A multiplier of 0.7 may be used to roughly approximate the impact of such controls on coincident demand, as follows:</p>
              <p>MLD prop < 0.7 * TLW prop</p>
              <p>MLD baseline > 0.7 * TLW baseline</p>
